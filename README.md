# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains example implementations of various design patterns in C#. Each pattern is demonstrated with practical examples and clear explanations.

## Patterns Included

1. **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. **Builder** - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
3. **Observer** - Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
4. **Facade** - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
5. **Factory** - Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
6. **Abstract Factory** - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
